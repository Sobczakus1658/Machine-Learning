# Course Projects  

## Project Overview  
As part of this course, we were required to complete four projects. We received a template in Google Colab with missing code sections that needed to be completed. To correctly understand and fill in the missing parts, we had to study the research paper provided for each task, along with the assignment instructions.  

## Project Descriptions  

- **Custom Backpropagation Variants** – Implemented a custom backward pass with alternative weight update strategies and compared performance against standard backpropagation methods.  
- **Data Augmentation** – Applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance model training and systematically evaluated their impact on performance.  
- **Multihead & Differential Attention** – Developed a complete Multihead Attention mechanism and explored Differential Attention for improved model interpretability and efficiency.  
- **Reinforcement Learning & Policy Optimization** – Designed and implemented reinforcement learning algorithms, focusing on policy optimization to mitigate sample inefficiency and training instability.
